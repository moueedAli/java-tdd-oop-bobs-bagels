# Bobs bagel

---
As a member of the public,\
So I can order a bagel before work,\
I'd like to add a specific type of bagel to my basket.
---
As a member of the public,\
So I can change my order,\
I'd like to remove a bagel from my basket.
---
As a member of the public,\
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket\
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.
---
As a Bob's Bagels manager,\
So that I can expand my business,\
Iâ€™d like to change the capacity of baskets.
---
As a member of the public\
So that I can maintain my sanity\
I'd like to know if I try to remove an item that doesn't exist in my basket.
---
As a customer,\
So I know how much money I need,\
I'd like to know the total cost of items in my basket.
---
As a customer,\
So I know what the damage will be,\
I'd like to know the cost of a bagel before I add it to my basket.
---
As a customer,\
So I can shake things up a bit,\
I'd like to be able to choose fillings for my bagel.
---
As a customer,\
So I don't over-spend,\
I'd like to know the cost of each filling before I add it to my bagel order.
---
As the manager,\
So we don't get any weird requests,\
I want customers to only be able to order things that we stock in our inventory.
